# 2026 Algorithm Mastery

Structured learning path - 14 topics, 65 problems, building from fundamentals to advanced patterns.

## Learning Philosophy

Each topic builds on previous concepts. No jumping around - linear progression enforces proper foundation-building.

**Why this order?**
1. **Arrays/Hashmaps/Two Pointers** - Core patterns that appear everywhere
2. **Stacks/Linked Lists** - Data structure fundamentals
3. **Bit Manipulation** - Low-level thinking before trees
4. **Binary Search/Sliding Window** - Optimization techniques
5. **Trees/Heaps** - Hierarchical & priority-based structures
6. **Backtracking/Graphs** - Complex search problems
7. **Dynamic Programming** - Ultimate optimization (requires all prior knowledge)

## Implementation Standards

Every solution includes:
- **C++ implementation** (focus on STL, modern C++17/20)
- **Python implementation** (clean, idiomatic)
- **Test cases** with edge cases covered
- **Time/space complexity** analysis in comments
- **Pattern notes** in problem README

## Progress Tracking

See `DSA_Tracker.md` for detailed problem list and completion status.

**Current Stats:**
- Problems Solved: 2/65
- Topics Completed: 0/14

## Comparison to 2025

The 2025-archive contains my initial attempts at algorithms. This 2026 folder represents a fresh start with:
- Better structure (topic-based vs. random)
- Cleaner code (6 months more experience)
- Deeper understanding (focus on patterns, not just solutions)
